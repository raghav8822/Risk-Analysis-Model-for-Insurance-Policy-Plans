## Risk Analysis Model for Insurance Policy Plans

### Overview
Developed a predictive model for insurance policy plans, incorporating a neural network and a random forest model to estimate claim risk percentages. The model is based on 27 parameters defining the plan.

### Key Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilized both neural networks and random forest models for robust prediction.
- **Extensive Feature Engineering**: Implemented techniques to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Addressed missing values and categorical variables to ensure data integrity.

### Implementation Details
- **Neural Network**: Constructed a deep learning model to capture complex relationships between the parameters and the claim risk percentages.
- **Random Forest Model**: Employed an ensemble learning method to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
- **Feature Engineering**: Included feature selection, transformation, and creation to optimize model performance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing data using imputation techniques and managed categorical variables through encoding methods.

### Results
The model demonstrated high accuracy in estimating claim risk percentages, aiding in the assessment and management of newly formed policy plans.
